How this game will be played
============================

(The words "captain" and "player" are used sort of interchageably in this text.)

Building a ship will test the player's ability to choose and place segments and modules in a way that provides a ship with good tactical advantages.

A good ship:
+ Moves fast and nimbly
+ Can hit targets at varying ranges with high precision
+ Can carry heavy loads
+ Can detect objects at great distances
+ Can avoid or absorb damage
+ Has a small signature to avoid detection
+ Provides good living conditions for the crew
+ Is easy to navigate and operate by the crew
+ Consumes little resources
+ Carries enough resources to operate autonomously for long periods
+ And provides any other tactical advantages that the captain wishes to have.


Managing a ship will test the players ability to navigate the universe, maintain morale, and gain fame and fortune through various acts of war, industry and/or trade.
